Store Design can expose any set of properties as long as your <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> declares them using the data types that Store Design supports.\r\n\r\n## Enabling Store Design Options\r\n\r\nTo provide merchants with Store Design customization options, you must declare those options in the theme's <span class=\"fn\">schema.json file</span>. You must also include those settings in your theme's <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> file, templates, and Sass/CSS files. The basic division of labor is this:\r\n* <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> is an array of objects, declaring which theme settings are editable in Store Design. These objects also declare all possible values to display in Store Design's GUI.\r\n* <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> assigns (and updates) a default value for each of the editable settings.\r\n* Each <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> entry has an id element that maps it to its corresponding config.json entry. The id value identifies the relevant config.json key name.\r\n* For front-matter properties to be editable, your theme's Handlebars template must call certain Handlebars helpers to transform the config.json entries into JavaScript values.\r\n* For fonts to be editable, a Sass stylesheet must call certain custom Sass functions to transform the <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> font entries into CSS values.\r\n* For styles to be editable, a Sass stylesheet must call certain custom Handlebars helpers to transform the <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> entries into CSS values.\r\n\r\nAs users select options within the Store Design UI (and save their selections), Stencil will automatically rewrite <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> to record new defaults for the theme.\r\n\r\n### File Management Requirements\r\n\r\nSee Stencil's default Cornerstone theme for examples that fulfill all of the above requirements. However, remember these hard requirements:\r\n\r\n* For any theme setting (such as a Sass variable or a front-matter value) to be merchant-customizable,\r\nthat setting – and its possible values – must be present in <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span>. You must manually provide these declarations, according to the structure described here.\r\n\r\n* Also, each key that you create in schema.json must have a corresponding <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> key whose name matches its id value. This <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> key sets the default value (even if that is simply an empty string). A <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> setting without an `id`-matched <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> key will not appear to users in the Store Design GUI.\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\nPlease follow these guidelines to head off errors upon theme upload, and to avoid possible loss of customizations made via the Store Design GUI at runtime:\r\n\r\n* Single-Instance Restriction per Storefront: We strongly recommend opening only one instance of Store Design, at a time, against each storefront. This is because there is currently no synchronization mechanism to reconcile configuration changes made by multiple Store Design instances. So <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> will record the last changes made by any instance – but changes saved earlier by other instances might be lost.\r\n\r\n* Single-Storefront Restriction per Editor: In the current release, users can have only one storefront at a time open in Store Design. (A workaround is to open an \"Incognito\"/private-browsing window on an additional storefront, to bypass the cookie that imposes this restriction.)\r\n\r\n* File Name, Location, and Structure: Your theme's <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> file must be named schema.json, must reside in the root of your `<theme-name>` subdirectory (e.g.: <span class=\"fp\">/cornerstone/schema.json</span>), and must be valid JSON.\r\n\r\n* File Size: The maximum allowable size for a theme's <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> file is 64 KB. Exceeding this limit will trigger an error upon uploading the theme to BigCommerce. (Other than this size constraint, there is no limit on the number of keys and values that you can place in a theme's <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span>.)\r\n\r\n## How .json Entries Govern Store Design's UI\r\n\r\nYour entries in the <span class=”fn”>schema.json</span> and <span class=”fn”>config.json</span> directly shape users' options in Store Design:\r\n* Theme Variations always appear at the top of the Store Design panel. These variations are defined only in <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span>, and their definition order in that file governs their display order in Store Design.\r\n* Merchants must select one variation to edit, at a time, in Store Design. The selections that they make in the remainder of Store Design's UI will apply to only that selected variation.\r\n* Store Design's remaining sequence of top-level (Section) headings corresponds directly to the sequence of top-level (Section) objects that you declare in `schema.json`\r\n\r\nThe options displayed within these expandable Section headings correspond directly to the keys/values that you nest within <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span>'s corresponding Section objects.\r\n\r\nIn all, the structure that you give your theme's <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span> and <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> files directly governs the UI that Store Design exposes to merchants. So these files provide your UI design tools.\r\n\r\n## Store Design Data Types\r\n\r\nStore Design supports these data types:\r\n* color\r\n* font\r\n* select [drop-down list]\r\n* checkbox\r\n* imageDimension\r\n* text\r\n\r\nWithin <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span>, each object's data type is declared in a statement like the one highlighted here:\r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-header\">\r\n    <div class=\"HubBlock-header-title flex items-center\">\r\n        <div class=\"HubBlock-header-name\"></div>\r\n    </div><div class=\"HubBlock-header-subtitle\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\ntitle: \"\"\r\nsubtitle: \"\"\r\nlineNumbers: true\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```json\r\n {\r\n        \"type\": \"color\",\r\n        \"label\": \"Text Color\",\r\n        \"id\": \"body-font-color\"\r\n      },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Types versus \"heading\" Labels\r\n\r\nWithin <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span>, you will also see `\"type\": \"heading\"` statements like this one – highlighted earlier in the same object used for the above example:\r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-header\">\r\n    <div class=\"HubBlock-header-title flex items-center\">\r\n        <div class=\"HubBlock-header-name\"></div>\r\n    </div><div class=\"HubBlock-header-subtitle\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\ntitle: \"\"\r\nsubtitle: \"\"\r\nlineNumbers: true\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"Colors\",\r\n    \"settings\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"heading\",\r\n        \"content\": \"General\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"color\",\r\n        \"label\": \"Text Color\",\r\n        \"id\": \"body-font-color\"\r\n      },\r\n    {...}\r\n     ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese `\"type\": \"heading\"` statements do not reference data types. Rather, they declare display captions for the Store Design UI's subcategories – the middle level nested within the Section headings, but outside the individual options from which merchants can select. (Those inner options are designated by `\"label\": <label-text>` statements.)\r\n\r\n## Store Design Data Structure in <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> \r\n\r\nThe <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> nesting structure that you just saw maps directly to the Store Design UI displayed to merchants: Below the `variations` section (whose data are imported from <span class=\"fn\">config.json</span>), the order and nesting of options in Store Design's UI directly matches the order and nesting of your <span class=\"fn\">schema.json</span> entries.\r\n\r\n## Store Design UI Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nYou may experience an issue when setting up the Store Design UI. For any unexpected behavior that you encounter while developing your Stencil theme, we recommend that you check the terminal window where you started Stencil CLI. In some cases, the terminal will provide a verbose error message specifying where to look for problems. For less-detailed error messages, see the below list of potential issues and diagnostic suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Empty Drop-Down List in Store Design Panel\r\n\r\n* **Symptom:** A drop-down list’s outline appears below its configured label. However, the list appears to be empty.\r\n* **Likely Cause:** A default value specified in the theme’s config.json file is not enumerated in the schema.json file.\r\n* **Resolution:** Update schema.json to include the config.json value.\r\n\r\n### Configured Control Missing from Store Design Panel\r\n* **Symptom:** A control that you have configured within schema.json is completely absent from the Store Design UI.\r\n* **Likely Cause:** The specified “type” is one of: text, text area, radio [button], or image. (Store Design does not currently support these data types.)\r\n* **Resolution:** Display the user option via one of the supported data types: color, font, select [drop-down list], or checkbox.\r\n\r\n### Theme Changes Not Saved from Store Design UI\r\n* **Symptom:** Changes saved in a browser’s Store Design panel are not reflected in the storefront.\r\n* **Likely Cause:** Check whether Store Design to customize the same storefront.\r\n* **Resolution:** We strongly recommend opening only one instance of Store Design, at a time, per storefront. BigCommerce currently provides no synchronization mechanism for configuration changes from multiple Store Design instances. So the storefront’s schema.json will record the last changes made by any instance – but changes saved earlier by other instances might be lost.\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
