The three variations of Cornerstone (Light, Warm, and Bold) are displayed across three separate cards.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    title: #### Desktop View of My Themes\r\n\r\n    data: //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563226648470\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Desktop View of My Themes\r\n![#### Desktop View of My Themes\r\n](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563226648470 \"#### Desktop View of My Themes\r\n\")\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    title: #### Desktop View of Themes Marketplace\r\n\r\n    data: //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563227303129\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Desktop View of Themes Marketplace\r\n![#### Desktop View of Themes Marketplace\r\n](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563227303129 \"#### Desktop View of Themes Marketplace\r\n\")\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    title: #### Mobile View of Themes Marketplace\r\n\r\n    data: //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563227341485\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Mobile View of Themes Marketplace\r\n![#### Mobile View of Themes Marketplace\r\n](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563227341485 \"#### Mobile View of Themes Marketplace\r\n\")\r\n\r\n## General Image Requirements\r\n\r\nBelow are details about:\r\n* how to size and save these images to stage them within your theme's directory structure\r\n* how to reference the images in your [config.json](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json) file.\r\n\r\nAll screenshots described below must meet the following specifications in order for the `stencil bundle` command to be able to process them:\r\n\r\n* Saved to a supported image file type: .jpg/.jpeg, .png, or .gif.\r\n* Be stored in your [<theme‑name>/meta/](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/tree/master/meta) subdirectory.\r\n* Must be in **portrait aspect ratio**, with specific resolutions listed under [Themewide Composite Image](#preparing_themewide-composite) below.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## Themewide Composite Image\r\n\r\nThe themewide composite image represents your theme in the control panel's **Storefront** › **My Themes**, which shows merchants their currently available themes (including any custom uploaded themes). \r\n\r\nThis file will normally be a mosaic of screenshots from multiple variations within your theme. It must meet the following requirements, beyond the general specifications above:\r\n\r\n* Resolution of 600 x 760 pixels (horizontal x vertical).\r\n* File size smaller than 2 MB.\r\n* Arbitrary filename prefix, referenced in your [config.json](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json) file as the `meta` object's `composed_image` key value.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a compliant file type and location:\r\n\r\n`<theme‑name>/meta/composed.png`\r\n\r\nHere is how you would reference this file within [config.json](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json):\r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-header\">\r\n    <div class=\"HubBlock-header-title flex items-center\">\r\n        <div class=\"HubBlock-header-name\">config.json</div>\r\n    </div><div class=\"HubBlock-header-subtitle\">Referencing composed.png</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\ntitle: \"config.json\"\r\nsubtitle: \"Referencing composed.png\"\r\nlineNumbers: true\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  [...]\r\n  \"meta\": {\r\n    [...]\r\n    \"composed_image\": \"composed.png\",\t\r\n    [...]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Variations: Desktop/Mobile Screenshots\r\n\r\nEach variation within your theme must be represented by two additional screenshots if you want that variation to appear in the control panel's  **Storefront** › **Themes Marketplace**, which shows merchants the themes that are available for download.\r\n\r\n### Desktop Screenshot\r\n\r\nThe first screenshot, showing your theme on a desktop viewport, must meet the following requirements beyond the general specifications above: \r\n* Resolution of 2048 x 2600 pixels (horizontal x vertical).\r\n* File size smaller than 5 MB\r\n* Arbitrary filename prefix, referenced in your [config.json](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json) file as the `variations` object's `desktop_screenshot` key value.\r\n\t\r\n### Mobile Screenshot\r\n\r\nThe second screenshot, showing your theme on a mobile viewport, must meet the following requirements beyond the general specifications above: \r\n* Resolution of 304 x 540 pixels (horizontal x vertical).\r\n* File size smaller than 1 MB.\r\n* Arbitrary filename prefix, referenced in your [config.json](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json) file as the `variations` object's `mobile_screenshot` key value.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example showing two files of compliant types and location:\r\n\r\n* `<theme‑name>/meta/desktop_bright.png`\r\n* `<theme‑name>/meta/mobile_bright.png`\t\r\n\r\nHere is how you would reference these files within [config.json](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json), for a variation named `Bright`:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-header\">\r\n    <div class=\"HubBlock-header-title flex items-center\">\r\n        <div class=\"HubBlock-header-name\">config.json</div>\r\n    </div><div class=\"HubBlock-header-subtitle\">Referencing Bright Variation</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\ntitle: \"config.json\"\r\nsubtitle: \"Referencing Bright Variation\"\r\nlineNumbers: true\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[...]\r\n  \"variations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"Bright\",\r\n      \"id\": \"bright\",\r\n      \"meta\": {\r\n        \"desktop_screenshot\": \"desktop_bright.png\",\r\n        \"mobile_screenshot\": \"mobile_bright.jpg\",\r\n    [...]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Related Articles\r\n* [Naming Your Theme and Theme Variations](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/deploying-a-theme/naming-your-theme)\r\n* [Checking a Theme's Size](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/deploying-a-theme/checking-a-themes-size)\r\n* [Bundling and Pushing a Theme](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/deploying-a-theme/bundling-and-pushing)"}],"children":[]}}}}
