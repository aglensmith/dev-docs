Email Invoice\r\n2. Merchant Printable Invoice\r\n3. Customer Printable Invoice\r\n4. Detailed Customer Printable Invoice (UK orders only)\r\n\r\nMerchants commonly request developers modify the default content of invoices in order to satisfy specific business requirements and industry demands. In order to assist developers in making these changes, this articles contains instructions on how to edit each invoice.\r\n\r\n## Email Invoice Template\r\n\r\nThe email invoice is sent to a customer after an order has been completed. The email invoice can be edited in the Control Panel in **Storefront** > **Email Templates** > <span class=\"fn\">invoice_email.html</span>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    title:\r\n    data: //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563210321373\r\n-->\r\n\r\n![](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563210321373 \"\")\r\n\r\nAfter clicking **Edit** on the right, the WYSIWYG Editor will appear. Follow Editing and Printing Invoices (Knowledge Base) to complete customization of the Invoice Email template.\r\n\r\n## Merchant Printable Invoice\r\n\r\nThe Merchant Printable Invoice is the invoice that can be printed from the control panel in **Orders** > **View**. Clicking the **...** in the Action column will generate a list of options, one option being **Print Invoice**.\r\n\r\n![Print Order Invoice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/customizing_invoice_print_order_invoice.png \"Order Invoice\")\r\n\r\nThe invoice that is generated by clicking Print Invoice relies on a template files and variables from [BigCommerce’s legacy Blueprint themes framework](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates). This invoice can be customized by performing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1.

Open the file in the text editor of your choice and edit the HTML file to match your desired customization.\r\n\r\n3. Use WebDAV to upload your customized HTML file to WebDAV’s /template/ folder. We recommend CyberDuck, the freeware [WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#webdav-client) client, available for Windows and Mac OS. Your store’s control panel offers a downloadable connection file prefilled with most store credentials.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock--callout\">\r\n<div class=\"CalloutBlock--\">\r\n<div class=\"HubBlock-content\">\r\n\r\n<!-- theme:  -->\r\n\r\n### Blueprint Variables and Customization\r\n> For a list of available variables, see [Blueprint Email Templates](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates).\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Customizing the Customer Printable Invoice\r\n\r\nThe customer printable invoice is the printable invoice that is available on a storefront’s order page for shoppers that have registered accounts with your store.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    title:\r\n    data: //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563210752661\r\n-->\r\n\r\n![](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1563210752661 \"\")\r\n\r\nThis invoice becomes available in a shopper’s orders after completing an order. A shopper can generate this invoice by clicking **Print Invoice** on the right-hand side of the page.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, you can customize this invoice by editing your theme’s <span class=\"fn\">invoice.html</span> file that is present in your theme’s files. In Cornerstone, this file is located in <span class=\"fp\">/cornerstone/templates/pages/account/orders/invoice.html</span>.\r\n\r\n## Customizing the Detailed Customer Printable Invoice\r\n\r\nThis invoice is used when a store recieves an order from a United Kingdom address.
