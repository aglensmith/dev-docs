For example:\n\n```json\n\"new_customer\": {\n        \"heading\": \"New Customer?\",\n        \"intro\": \"Create an account with us and you'll be able to:\",\n        \"fact1\": \"Get customer perks\",\n        \"fact2\": \"Place a recurring order\"\n        }\n```\n\n### Login Form Redirect\nBy default, customers are redirected to `/account.php` upon login, but you have the option to redirect customers to another relative URL. You can do this by passing the parameter `id=\"redirect_to\"` with a `value={path}` on a hidden form field within the `<form>` element in the template. For example:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"redirect_to\" name=\"redirect_to\" value=\"/shop-all\">\n```\nWhen the form is submitted a POST request is sent to BigCommerce to validate the login information. At this point, the customer will be redirected to the page you defined.\n\nOnly relative URLs are supported for security reasons."}],"children":[]}}}}
