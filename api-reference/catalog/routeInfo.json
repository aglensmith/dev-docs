Endpoints](#available-endpoints)\n- [Price List Assignment Order of Operations](#price-list-assignment-order-of-operations)\n- [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)\n\nA Price List allows you to populate different versions of catalog pricing and assign them to different [Customer Groups](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api). The prices are specified exclusively at the variant level. \n\nThe association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)\n\nAdditionally, [Price List Assignments](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/price-lists/price-lists-records/) can be created to assign Price Lists to a specific [Channel](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/channels-listings-api). Price lists assigned to a channel apply to all shoppers on that channel, unless there is a more specific assignment.\n\nIf an active Price List does not contain prices for a variant then the Catalog pricing will be used. The association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)\n\nPrice Lists will provide overridden price values to the Stencil storefront. Final price display can be further customized within the Stencil template. See the [Price Object](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/price-object-properties) in Stencil for further documentation.\n\nTo learn more about Price Lists, see [here](/api-docs/price-lists/price-list-overview). \n\n## OAuth Scopes\n| UI Name                                      | Permission | Parameter                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Products                                     | modify     | `store_v2_products`                           |\n| Products                                     | read-only  | `store_v2_products_read_only`                 |\n\nFor more information on OAuth Scopes, see: [Authentication](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication).\n\n## Authentication\nRequests can be authenticated by sending a `client_id` and `access_token` via `X-Auth-Client` and `X-Auth-Token` HTTP headers:\n\n```http\nGET /stores/{$$.env.store_hash}/v3/catalog/summary\nhost: api.bigcommerce.com\nAccept: application/json\nX-Auth-Client: {client_id}\nX-Auth-Token: {access_token}\n```\n\n|Header|Parameter|Description|\n|-|-|-|\n|`X-Auth-Client`|`client_id`|Obtained by creating an API account or installing an app in a BigCommerce control panel.|\n|`X-Auth-Token`|`access_token `|Obtained by creating an API account or installing an app in a BigCommerce control panel.|\n\nFor more information on Authenticating BigCommerce APIs, see: [Authentication](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication).\n\n## Available Endpoints\n| Resource / Endpoint                     | Description                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Price List Records                      | Create and manage price list records                                    |\n| Price Lists                             | Create and manage catalog pricing variations                            |\n| Price List Assignments                  | Assign price lists to Channels\n\n## Price List Assignment Order of Operations\n\nThe `Price List Assignment` Pricing Order of Operations is as follows:\n\n**IF** `Price list` assigned to current `Customer Group` **AND** `Price List` assigned to current `Channel`:\n* Use this Price List -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)\n\n**ELSE IF**: `Price List` assigned to current `Channel`:\n* Use this price list -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)\n\n**ELSE IF** `Price List` assigned to current `Customer Group`:\n* Use this price list -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)\n\n**ELSE IF** `Customer Group Discounts`:\n* Use them -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)\n\n**ELSE IF** `channel` has a `default price list`:\n* Use this price list -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)\n\n**ELSE**:\n* Fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)\n\n**Note:** Price Lists cannot be assigned to a customer group that has custom group discounts -- the customer group discounts must be deleted first.\n\n## Usage Notes\n- Price Lists cannot be assigned to a customer group that has custom group discounts -- the customer group discounts must be deleted first.\n- Bulk Pricing Tiers may additionally be associated with a Price Record to indicate different pricing as the quantity in cart increases.\n- If a variant has a `Price Record` any existing product-level bulk pricing will not apply in the cart. For variants without `Price Records`, any existing product bulk pricing will apply.\n- Price Lists Records accepts bulk upsert. Only one [Bulk upsert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists-records/setpricelistrecordcollection) can done at a time. Running more than one in parallel on the **same store** will cause a 429 error and the request will fail. \n\n### Related Endpoints\n* [Get Price List Collection](/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists/getpricelistcollection)\n\n### Webhooks Available\nThere are no direct webhooks available for Price Lists.
