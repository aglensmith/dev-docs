Below are some examples of these providers:\r\n    \r\n    -   PayPal Express\r\n    -   Braintree\r\n    -   Stripe \r\n    -   Square\r\n    -   Amazon\r\n    -   Klarna\r\n  \r\n-   It provides a JavaScript interface for interacting with the web API.\r\n    -   Fetch and submit resources:\r\n        -   Cart\r\n        -   Order\r\n        -   Customer\r\n    -   Fetch available options:\r\n        -   Shipping addresses\r\n        -   Shipping countries\r\n        -   Shipping states\r\n        -   Billing addresses\r\n        -   Billing countries\r\n        -   Billing states\r\n        -   Shipping methods\r\n        -   Payment methods\r\n \r\nThe Checkout JS SDK allows you to present the checkout process to the shopper in any way you like, and, through frontend technologies and external web services, augment the checkout with extra information. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Checkout JS SDK does not allow you to change the underpinnings of the checkout - you must still conform to the model of the Checkout API underpinning the SDK to complete a Checkout and create an Order in BigCommerce. \r\nThe SDK does not allow you to implement custom payment, shipping, or tax calculation providers into the checkout - instead, the configured providers for these services on a given store are expressed via our Checkout API.\r\n\r\n## Where Can I Get the SDK?\r\nThe Checkout JS SDK and associated documentation is available from the [BigCommerce SDK Repo.]( https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js)\r\n\r\n## Support and Customization\r\n- Enterprise clients can reach out to their account manager to review services and resources available.\r\n- For more on our design policy please visit [Design Support](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-Design-Policy#support).\r\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
