Customers can check out on an external storefront while their order information syncs simultaneously to the BigCommerce Control Panel. You can see this in action within the BigCommerce for WordPress plugin, which uses the same process described here as a checkout option for merchants. View more information about the plugin in the article [BigCommerce for Wordpress](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/getting-started/introduction).\n\n<a id=\"how-it-works\"></a>\n\n## How it Works\n\nEmbedded Checkout uses an HTML `<iframe>` to display BigCommerce's PCI compliant Optimized One-Page Checkout on non-BigCommerce web pages.\n\nIf your channel site doesn't match the URL from which you're making a request to a BigCommerce, you will get a security error and the checkout will not load. Additionally, if requests to your BigCommerce store aren't served over HTTPS, you will also see an error.\n\n<a id=\"channels-sites-and-routes-apis\"></a>\n\n## Channels, Sites and Routes APIs\n\nYou will need to use the [Channels, Sites and Routes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/channels-listings-api) APIs to embed checkout on an external site. The Channels API allows you to create and manage sales channel listings across a merchant's product catalog. A channel can be a marketplace, like Amazon, or an external storefront, like a WordPress site. The Sites and Routes APIs let you set an external storefront domain and define the paths for important pages, like the home page, cart page, or checkout page. The site and routes are used to link back to the proper URL from invoice emails and storefront links.\n\n<a id=\"bigcommerce-checkout-sdk\"></a>\n\n## BigCommerce Checkout SDK\n\nEmbedded Checkout requires the BigCommerce Checkout SDK to invoke a method that can render the checkout in your site. Learn more about the [Checkout SDK](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/cart-and-checkout/checkout-sdk).\n\n<a id=\"embedded-logged-in-customers\"></a>\n\n## Logged-In Customers\n\nCustomers are handled in two steps. First, you need to pass the customer_id when creating the cart. Second, you need to log in the customer so the session is active when the checkout loads. This is done through the [Customer Login API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/customers/customer-login-api).\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
