Here are the warnings and their meanings:\n\n| Warning |\n|-|\n| (These messages do not have numeric codes) |\n| Issue in processing this theme's thumbnail screenshot (`composed_image`). |\n| Issue in processing this theme's full-size screenshot (`desktop_screenshot`). |\n| Issue in processing this theme's mobile [screenshot](/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/config-json-metadata) (`mobile_screenshot`). |\n| Missing file: This theme does not support Theme Editor, as it is missing its required `[schema.json]` file. |\n| One or more of this theme's screenshots are not image files. |\n| Theme is missing a valid thumbnail image `composed_image`). |\n| Theme is missing a valid full-size image `desktop_screenshot`). |\n| Theme is missing a valid mobile image (`mobile_screenshot`). |\n| One or more of this theme's images is not of a supported file type. Valid filetypes are: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`. |\n| Thumbnail (`composed_image`) image dimensions are not right. Expected 600 x 760 pixels. |\n| Full-size (`desktop_screenshot`) image dimensions are not right. Expected 2048 x 2600 pixels. |\n| Mobile (`mobile_screenshot`) image dimensions are not right. Expected 304 x 540 pixels. |\n| Too-large image file size for a theme screenshot `composed_image` (thumbnails), `desktop_screenshot`, or `mobile_screenshot`] . The maximum supported size is x, but the file's actual size is y. |\n\n## Workarounds and Further Info\n\nIf a custom theme does not render properly after you upload and apply it to a storefront, make sure you have created the theme's `.zip` file using the `stencil bundle` command, on a Mac OS, Linux computer, or virtual machine. This will exclude Windows-specific errors that have occurred on some bundles.\n\nIf you repeatedly encounter the same error or warning and neither this page nor our KB resolves the problem, see support resources for theme developers in our [Developer Community](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/group/0F913000000HLjECAW/bigcommerce-developers).\n"}],"children":[]}}}}
